This project is a Star Wars themed wiki website. It includes a home page, films page, video games page and 3 TV Series pages. The website allows anyone to find out information about the events and characters in the Star Wars Universe.

<h2>Design Process</h2>

During the development of my website, I tried to understand what users who would visit my website expect and what they wish for. Below are two varying perspectives of certain users who would visit Star Wars Wiki.

1. As a Star Wars fan, I would expect to see many of my favourite Star Wars characters and also up to date information such as Mandalorian Season 2 which was aired in November 2020. I would also want to be able to search for any of the characters even the ones that were introduced decades ago.

2. As someone who is new to Star Wars, I would wish for a simplistic web design so I am able to grasp what is trending at the moment but also for a way to research the lore and history of older characters so I am not missing out on anything. 

Judging from these views, my website should be kept up to date, contain past history of Star Wars characters and have a simplitic and intuitive design. I also intend to make SWiki both desktop and mobile friendly. I have created wireframes for both Desktop and Mobile views for an optimal experience. 

I was sure to keep my code well documented, especially my style.css file because it is quite lengthy and contains all the CSS for every page in SWiki. This is so if anyone else were to view my work, they would be able to understand the purpose of that section of code easily.


UPDATE: 4/1/2021: I made large changes to the wireframes for the website such as swapping out static images with video embeds and changing stale paragraphs of text with accordions using Bootstrap v5.0's Accordion Component.

<h2>Features</h2>

Since SWiki's main goal is to provide information about Star Wars i implemented several features to guarantee that the navigation is intuitive and the experience is memorably good.

1. Utilizing Bootstrap v5.0's Card Component while also utilizing my own CSS to modify it. I found these "Cards" extremely useful in showcasing certain characters in a simplistic form as they are already mostly responsive and also include a space for the description of said character.
2. Search function that allows users to input the name of any Star Wars character found in SWAPI and retrieve specfic details about them such as which films they appeared in or simply their height and weight.

<h2>Testing</h2>
Testing is very important in programming and is especially imperative in front web development because any bugs will be extremely obvious and annoying to any user visiting the website.

<h3>Possible Problems</h3>

The API i chose to use, SWAPI stated in its documentation that it has a limit of 10,000 requests a day. Though it is unlikely to hit this high limit, it should be kept in mind.
